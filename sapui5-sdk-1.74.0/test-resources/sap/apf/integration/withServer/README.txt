WithServer tests not executed in testsuite:
=====================================================================

All tests in this file are executed manually against a server. The manual steps are described in the 
internal document proxySettings.txt. Thus, they are not part of a testsuite. To run them in the Web IDE 
you can use the following files:

	testrunner.xs.integration.withServer.html
	testrunner.xs.withServer.html
	testrunner.gateway.withServer.html
