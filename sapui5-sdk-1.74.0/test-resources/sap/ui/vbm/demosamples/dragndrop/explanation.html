		<p>This sample application demonstrates the following two features:
		<ul>
		<li>The interactive creation of visual objects, and
		<li>a possible use of drag and drop between visual objects on the map.
		</ul>		
		Initially we show two locations as spots on the map and a direct route between them. The idea of the application is to create further locations on the 
		map and to extend the route by dragging and dropping it onto a new location. The dropped route is split into two new routes, to and from the drop location.</p>
		
		<p>In the footer bar is a button <i>Trigger Spot creation</i>. If pressed we use GeoMap function <code>getPositionInteractive</code> to trigger the interactive creation mode.
		In this mode the cursor over the map turns into an aiming cross. Once you click on a certain position on the map the prior given callback function is called receiving the
		geo-position of the click. In this function the actual object creation takes place. This gives the developer the full control on the kind and properties of the create VO.
		Furthermore the newly created spot is marked as a suitable drop target for routes.</p>

		<p>Now the route can be dragged over the newly created location. A possible drop is indicated by a cursor change. Note: The actual appearance of the cursor is operating system specific.
		When the route is dropped, the spot fires the drop event. In the event handler we split the dropped route into two new routes.

				<p>This is the event handler for the press event of the button that is located in the footer toolbar. We call the GeoMap function 
				<code>getPositionInteractive</code>. The first parameter of the function indicates whether we want multiple positions or not.
				Since we need only one position it is set to <i>false</i>. </p>
				<p>As second parameter we pass a callback function. In this function we actually create the new <code>Spot</code> object at
				the given position.</p>
				<p>Of special importance is the assignment of a <code>DropTarget</code> with a type matching the drag source of the routes and 
				the registration of the handler <code>onDrop</code> for the <i>drop</i> event.</p>
				<p>With addition <code>.bind(this)</code> we set the controller as scope for the callback function.</p>

				<p>In the handler function for the <i>drop</i> event we receive the instance of the dragged VO as event parameter <i>oDragSource</i>
				and the drop target as event source <i>oSource</i>. Thus we can read the position of the location for the route split from the
				event source. </p>
				<p>We also read the route position from the drag source object. In our sample the routes are always direct connection between a start and an end position.
				A position in Visual Business is given as a string "[lon];[lat];0" and for routes two or more such positions are concatenated to a position array with a 
				semicolon as separator. Thus we split the position string of the route into an array. The array should contain 6 elements. The function <code>splice(0,3)</code>
				returns us the first three and we join them directly to a semicolon separated string again. This gives the start location. Further the slice function removed
				the first there elements from the array. We also join the remaining array elements and receive the end position.</p>
				<p>Now we create two new routes. One from start position to the drop location and one from the drop location to the end position.</p>
				<p>Finally we remove the dropped route from the map, since it has been replaced now with the two new ones.</p>
